Fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya bought properties worth Rs 330 crore in England and France during 2015-16 even as his Kingfisher Airlines was facing a cash crunch at the same time, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has claimed in its supplementary chargesheet filed in a Mumbai court.

It was the same time when banks had not recovered the loans defaulted by the liquor baron, the CBI chargesheet stated.

In the chargesheet, CBI stated Mallya had enough money between 2008 and 2017 to repay banks, from where he had taken loans for his Kingfisher Airlines Limited (KAL).

However, he bought "personal assets" across Europe and transferred money to his children's trusts in Switzerland.

The CBI, after taking permission from the court, sent out a communication to various countries asking for Mallya's transaction details.

The agency received information that Mallya had bought real estate in France for 35 million euros and had sought to make a payment of 8 million euros from an account of one of his companies, Gizmo Holdings.

Mallya left India in 2016 and is said to be residing in the United Kingdom, while proceedings are underway to bring him back to face trial.

Mallya is an accused in the alleged over Rs 900 crore IDBI Bank-Kingfisher Airlines loan fraud case being probed by the CBI.

The probe agency has named the 11 accused earlier chargesheeted, and has also added the name of Buddhadev Dasgupta, former general manager of IDBI Bank, in its latest supplementary chargesheet.
